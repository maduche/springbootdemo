Summary

Over the past year, I have strengthened my proficiency design, development and testing on  Check ByPhone ACH, Overdraft collection payments ,
On US CBP and address doctor and quartz batch jobs, notification of change and return payments processing. I also gained subject matter expertise on over draft, return 
payment processing and notification changes ensuring smoother development process. Also ,I have focused on preventing production issues by being proactive
 in testing, improving code quality, and collaborating with QA and Operations teams.

1. Technical Expertise
Over the past year, I have focused on my Full Stack development skills, particularly with Java ,Spring Boot, Mongo DB, Angular.
I have successfully contributed to and led critical requirement such as check by phone ACH, Overdraft Collection Payments,
On US CBP and Address Doctor, and Quartz Batch Jobs. These projects allowed me to deepen my understanding of complex system architecture 
and refine my problem-solving abilities.

One technical area where I excelled was in automating batch jobs using Quartz, ensuring timely and efficient processing. 

2. Leadership and Mentorship:
I consistently took on a mentoring role within the team guiding them through best coding practices, code reviews, and helping them navigate through complex tasks.
I’m proud to have contributed to creating a culture of continuous learning within the team.

3. Communication and Stakeholder Engagement
My communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders has improved significantly. 
I regularly engage with product managers, designers, leads and teams to ensure that technical feasibility aligns with business objectives.
I recognize that i had to enhance my communication skills by Active Listening, Written Communication, Tailoring communication to the Audience etc:
 
 
4. Impact and Initiative:
In terms of impact, I contributed quartz batch application structure which adds n number of jobs(ACH Return Job, Payment Reminder Job, Payment In Process Job, NOC JOB) to configure for future. All jobs are configured at one place and 
Code maintainability/readability is simple

 
5. Adaptability and Growth
This year, I focused on learning more about cloud computing, specifically with Azure certification certification. I also kept up with industry trends by attending online conferences and workshops
, which helped me bring new ideas to the team, such as experimenting with serverless architectures.

6.Goals for Next Year
In the next year, I plan to dedicate more time to learning on front end ( React, Angular ) and cloud and to further enhance my skill set.


Overall, I am proud of the progress I’ve made in my technical and leadership abilities over the last year.
My contributions have positively impacted the team’s efficiency and product quality. Moving forward, 
I will continue to build on my strengths while addressing areas for growth to become a more well-rounded and effective engineer.



Risk

I have focused on preventing production issues by being proactive in testing, improving code quality, and collaborating with QA and Operations teams. 
Through continuous learning and process improvements, I’ve helped ensure that our systems remain stable and reliable in production, resulting in fewer incidents
 and higher customer satisfaction. Moving forward, I will continue to build on these efforts to maintain production excellence.
 
Area of focus
 
I also worked extensively on front end development, which is an area I am actively improving. While I have gained proficiency in front end tools and frameworks,
I recognize that I need to enhance my skills further, especially in developing user-friendly interfaces that align well with back end processes.
I’ve also taken proactive steps to address technical debt on schedule series on digital and POPS UI, especially in older parts of the codebase, 
improving overall performance and reducing maintenance costs. However, I recognize that there’s still work to be done in this area, 
and I aim to continue addressing technical debt while balancing new feature development.One area where I would like to improve is proactively addressing technical debt. While I have worked on features with clear business priorities,
I acknowledge that some parts of the codebase still require refactoring to ensure long-term maintainability.
