We updated the design to use Orchestra retry, so it no longer sends the same message repeatedly. During testing, we noticed that some unique messages were marked as consume_success even though the consumer didn't process them.

We are not publishing the same message again. Our design sends a unique message and retries using orchestration if there’s a consume failure. Now, we see some messages marked as consume_success even though they were not consumed. I’ll set up a meeting based on your availability, as this needs to be fixed for the release.

public class HourDifferenceOldWay {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date date1 = new Date(); // now
        Date date2 = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - 5 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 5 hours ago

        long diffMillis = date1.getTime() - date2.getTime();
        long hoursDiff = diffMillis / (1000 * 60 * 60);

        System.out.println("Hours between: " + hoursDiff); // Output: 5
    }
}
Message Status Set to Consumed Without Actual Processing
We saw that some messages were marked as consumed even though they were not. Out of 10 messages, only 6 were really consumed, but 4 got the consumed status by mistake. We should only set the status after the message is actually consumed. Also, message consumption should be turned off in other environments.
