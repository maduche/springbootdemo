Collaborative Development Process: Pairing, Mobbing, and Swarming

Pairing, Mobbing, and Swarming  focus on bringing teams together to leverage collective expertise, solve problems efficiently, and foster shared understanding.

Pairing, Mobbing, and Swarming are  suited to different scenarios:

Pairing focuses on small-scale collaboration, often between two people.
Mobbing involves a small group, generally to tackle complex or high-value work.
Swarming scales up to larger teams for addressing urgent or high-priority issues.


Pair Programming: 
Two developers work together on the same piece of code, sharing one computer. One writes the code (Driver), while the other reviews and provides guidance (Navigator).

Ideal Use Cases:
Mentoring: A senior developer guides a junior team member, improving skill transfer.
Code Quality: Helps in avoiding defects by having real-time reviews.
Problem Solving: Focused and deep work on challenging sections of code.

Best Practices:
Switch roles every 30–60 minutes to maintain engagement.
Use tools like Visual Studio Live Share for remote pairing.
Focus discussions on solving the problem, not on peripheral details.


Mob Programming: A small team works together on the same task, using a single shared screen. Everyone contributes to solving the problem, 
while roles like Driver, Navigator, and Observers rotate periodically.

Ideal Use Cases:
Complex Design Discussions: Creating new architecture or tackling intricate logic.
Onboarding: Introducing new team members to the codebase and team processes.
Knowledge Sharing: Encourages cross-functional learning by bringing diverse perspectives.

Best Practices:
Define the problem and desired outcomes before starting.
Rotate roles every 20–30 minutes for balanced participation.
Avoid “groupthink” by actively encouraging diverse opinions.

Tools:
Shared coding platforms (e.g., IntelliJ Code With Me).
Collaborative whiteboarding tools for brainstorming.


Swarming
A larger group collaborates intensely to resolve critical incidents or high-priority issues. Participants may split into smaller subgroups for efficiency and reassemble periodically to sync progress.

Ideal Use Cases:
Critical Bug Fixes: When production issues impact many users or clients.
Time-Sensitive Deliverables: Urgent work that requires immediate attention.
Major Feature Rollouts: Coordinating complex, multi-team efforts for releases.
Best Practices:

Assign a facilitator to maintain focus and document progress.
Break the problem into smaller parts and delegate tasks to subgroups.
Conduct regular check-ins to integrate solutions and ensure alignment.

Tools:

Incident management platforms (e.g., PagerDuty, ServiceNow).
Video conferencing and collaboration tools for real-time communication.

If yes, we’ll share our test accounts to verify if it’s hitting OCP GUS.
