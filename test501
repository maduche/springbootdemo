Just checking â€” what should be the behavior when saving paymentAuthorization if DCBS returns code 51 during the 6:00 AM batch?

Should we save the 6:00 AM response with code 51 and later update it with the 9:00 PM response?

Also, we set the order status to "Initiated" before calling DCBS. Since this is common code, should we do the same during the 9:00 PM batch as well?
