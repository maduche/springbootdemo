APS Funding Step – Balance Retrieval Behavior Based on CACS Toggle

When CACS Toggle is OFF:
There are no issues retrieving the balance for both Debit and CBP payments of Fiserv and ODCR through the APS service.
The Account Number is a mandatory field and is correctly passed in this flow.

When CACS Toggle is ON:
There is an issue retrieving the balance for CBP payments (for both Fiserv and ODCR) via the CACS Get Account Details service.
This service requires both Account Number and Company Number.
In the CBP flow, the Company Number is coming as null, which causes the balance retrieval to fail—so the step is bypassed.

However, Debit payments are working as expected because both Account Number and Company Number are available from the DCBS call.

Note:
This is an existing issue, not introduced by the recent changes.

Design Question:
When CACS is enabled, should we call the CACS Get Account Details service for both Fiserv and CBP flows, or only for ODCR?
