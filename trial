Search Party Call – This identified multiple customers (true).
ECPR - Customer Profile Call – We retrieved the profile for the first customer and received a response. However, we could not find a matching account number in the ECPR customer profile, resulting in null values for the product code and company number. Consequently, POPS threw an error.
