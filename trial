We have configured Orchestra Producer to retry all failed messages from the event store. Currently, if we enable retry, it processes all consume_error entries for all producer topics.

However, we want to disable retries for Topic A and enable retries only for Topic B consume_error messages.

Can this be controlled through Orchestra configurations to allow retry for specific topics only?
